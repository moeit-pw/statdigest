	<p>The Ministry of Education in Palau is pleased to introduce to you the Education Statistical Yearbook 2017. While the issue of timeliness and data quality remain the key barriers in the whole process of data collection, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has made significant change on this statistical output with the technical support of the regional Education Management Information System (EMIS) facility team from the Secretariat of Pacific Community.</p>

	<p>The education statistics presented in this Statistical Yearbook are divided into seven main sections, these are Education System in Palau, School Information, Student Information, Student Assessments, Teacher Infor- mation, Fiscal Information, 2017-2026 Education Master Plan, and Key Indicators. This Statistical Yearbook primarily captures data on MOE mandated areas in primary and secondary schools. It is imperative for MOE to consolidate its education statistics in a collective database. This way forward will require a review on school data collection processes and the core functions and roles for planning, management, and policy decision- making.</p>

	<p>This Education Statistical Yearbook 2017 is a step forward towards a comprehensive data collection and data validity systems in the future that will range from the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), Primary Education, Secondary Education, Post-Secondary Education for Education Statistics in Palau. The Ministry of Education relies on collaborative efforts from partner agencies for data collection and compilation of a compre- hensive Education Statistical Yearbook for the entire education system of Palau.</p>

	<p>The time series data are made available in this Statistical Yearbook to enable you, our partners, and end users of education statistics to have a holistic understanding of our education system. Planners and policy makers as well as researchers from all levels could source their information from this Statistical Yearbook for future refer- ence. I would like to encourage schools and communities at large to make good use of the data that is published in this Statistical Yearbook.</p>

	<p>Access to quality data is critical in all levels of policy formulation and decision making as we work collectively toward the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 4 to provide quality education. Hence, evidence- based information needs to be automated and regularly disseminated to the public for our national government, our schools, our partners, and communities to make informed decisions.</p>
