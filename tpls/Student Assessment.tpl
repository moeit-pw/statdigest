<p>Palau English Reading Assessment (PERA) is a criterion test based on the current MOE English reading curriculum for Grades 1-8. The test assesses the elements of reading in phonics, vocabulary, literary ele- ments, and reading comprehension. Students’ scores on the PERA do not affect their grades. Figure 6 shows the PERA pre and post student results for school year 2017.</p>

<p>The Stanford Achievement Test 10th Edition (SAT10) is an internationally recognized United States stand- ardized test that is used by the Ministry to measure subject area content and process skills in reading, lan- guage, spelling, study skills, listening, mathematics, science and social science. SAT 10 is a norm- referenced test which involves a comparison of students’ scores against a norm reference group of U.S. stu- dents that took the same test.</p>

<p>Caution should be taken when interpreting the performance of students on the SAT10 Achievement Test in view of the differences between Palau students and US norm group. The SAT10 test results are defined using the following stanine score range; 1, 2, and 3 is below average; 4, 5, or 6 is average and 7, 8, or 9 is above average. Figure 6 shows that on average, public schools stanine ranking is at 3.3 in comparison to a 2007 norm reference group in United States.</p>

<h3>Teacher Counts and Ratios</h3>

<p>In accordance with Palau’s national civil service rules and regulations, all public school teachers go through a certification process in which they must qualify by satisfying specific requirements. It is through such certifi- cation system that all public school teachers are initially certified. In relation, Palau’s National Code Title 22 is awaiting further legislation from Palau’s congress prior to its full implementation of teacher’s certification by the Ministry of Education. (See Annex for Palau’s National Civil Service and PNC Title 22)</p>
