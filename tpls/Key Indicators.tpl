<p>In conjunction with the Palau Ministry of Education 10-year Education Master Plan for 2017-2026. The analysis of this 2017 Statistical Yearbook is mainly focused on statistics related to education sector with key indicators indicated within the new master plan. The grouping of indicators is clustered into five main policy goals focusing on student success.</p>

<p>Student success rely on many variables and this report aims to showcase needed data to assist in decision making and to get Palau students to be successful in Palau’s society and the world. Teaching and learning are the core business for MOE for which student enrollment and performance are valuable factors. For the past three years, student enrollment has continued to decrease in relation to the Republic of Palau’s census counts. Figure 11 shows the student enrollment by grade level indicating the decreasing trend line. The stu- dent assessment results are reported on page 19 to 25 of this publication.</p>

<p>In 2017, MOE recorded 1625 students who enrolled in elementary schools and 610 students enrolled in high school. In total, there are 2235 students enrolled in Grade 1 to Grade 12. Figure 12 is showing that there are more males (53%) then females (47%) in both public elementary and high school.</p>

<p>Another valuable factor to student success is their daily school absences. Student absences are recorded dai- ly by each homeroom teacher in all public schools. On a quarterly basis, absence data are collected and stored within the MOE student information system. The average daily absence rate in all public schools from Grades 1-12 is at 6.2%. Figure 13 shows the attendance rate of each quarter and grade level. In 2017, Grade 2 and 10 show a high absence rate as compared to other grade levels but overall, the absentee rate stayed be- low 12% of the enrolled students.</p>

<p>Education and instructional leadership is one of the essential policy goals of the new 2026 Education Master Plan. There are 233 teachers in the teaching force of whom 89% of them are Palauan and 8% are Filipino teachers. The remaining 3% belong to other ethnic groups. The Filipino teachers are mainly teach- ing Math and Science in Palau’s public high school. Figure 14 illustrates the academic level of teachers who are currently teaching in Palau public schools. About 38.6% are teachers with a high school diploma, some college credits, and have a certificate of achievement, 36.9% have an associate degree, 20.6% are bachelor degree holders and 3.9% of them have their Master’s degree.</p>

<p>Curriculum Enhancement is another on-going activity at the Ministry of Education geared towards student success. The cur- riculum focuses on five core subject areas, which are Palauan studies, English, math, science, and social studies.</p>

<p>In addition, work is underway to also include health and physical education. To date, English and math curricula frameworks were revised in 2013. Science was also revised in 2015. Health is currently under revision and will be piloted in schools in school year 2017. The other curriculum frameworks, which include so- cial studies, Palauan studies, and physical education, are sched- uled for revision soon as funding becomes available.</p>

<p>MOE Resource Support is another valuable goal for MOE’s plans toward student success. MOE resource support could be improved if the Ministry is equipped with sufficient resources and relevant staff. This year the Ministry of Education has rec- orded 428 staff, there is a Minister of Education, 2 bureau direc- tors, 4 division chiefs, 14 school principals, 3 vice principals and 233 classroom teachers. All teachers’ salaries are paid by Palau’s National Government. The rest of the MOE employees are sup- port staff.</p>

<p>The share of budget allocated to the Ministry of Education as percentage of the National Government budget was at 10% in 2017. About 74.6% of the Education budget in 2017 was spent on personnel salaries, which include classroom teachers.</p>

<p>Prior to its unremitting support in strengthening teaching and learning in the classroom, the Ministry of Education has provided schoolbooks and instructional supplies to all public schools since 1981. About 3% of the MOE national recurrent budget has been spent on schoolbooks and Instructional supplies.</p>

<p>Finally, Partnership Support is the support given by a number of government and non-government agencies, which foster student success. Figure 15 shows a list of support agencies that have been instrumental in as- sisting Palau students excel on their studies.</p>
